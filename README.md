## Crates
- Lonelybot is a library crate with #no_std support, and can be use in webassembly
- Lonecli is a binary wrapper crate on lonelybot to provide the features through CLI

## Features

- **Partial information support** via the `partial` module. Hidden cards are represented as `Option<Card>` and can be filled randomly with `fill_unknowns_randomly`.
- **Bayesian inference** using `column_probabilities` to estimate hidden cards.
- **Strategic play styles** through the `PlayStyle` enum (`Conservative`, `Neutral`, `Aggressive`).
- **Expert heuristics** configurable with `HeuristicConfig` and used in `ranked_moves` and Monte Carlo search.
- **Ranked move output** with heuristic and simulation scores plus blocking status.
- **State analysis** via `analyze_state` giving unknown count, remaining cards, mobility and deadlock risk.
- **MCTS based solver** available through `best_move_mcts`.
- **Partial JSON loading** where `"unknown"` or `-1` values denote hidden cards.
- **Python bindings** exposing the above features for scripting.

You'd probably want to use `lonecli`. To run it with `cargo`,

```sh
cd lonecli
cargo run --release -- help
```


## Build mode
- release: use lto (cargo build --release)
- dev: thin lto + debug info => for easy profiling (cargo build --profile=dev)
- release-with-debug: Release + debug info (cargo build --profile=release-with-debug)
- debug: default rust debug (cargo build)
- bench: For micro-benchmarking (cargo bench)

## Python bindings

The directory `python/lonelybot_py` contains PyO3 bindings exposing the solver
to Python. Install [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) and run:

```sh
cd python/lonelybot_py
maturin develop
```

This installs a `lonelybot_py` module providing `GameState`, `Move`,
`ranked_moves`, `best_move`, `best_move_mcts`, `column_probabilities` and
`analyze_state`.  The helper `python/utils.py` includes a `parse_hidden()`
function for loading JSON states with `"unknown"` or `-1` values.

## Seed
There are 7 seed types
- ``default``: using Rust rng
- ``legacy``: similar to default, for compatibility with older version of this engine
- ``solvitaire``: re-implementation of [Solvitaire](https://github.com/thecharlieblake/Solvitaire) random
- ``klondike``-solver: re-implementation of [Klondike-Solver](https://github.com/ShootMe/Klondike-Solver) random
- ``greenfelt``: re-implementation of [Greenfelt](https://greenfelt.net/) based on [Minimal-Klondike](https://github.com/ShootMe/MinimalKlondike) source code
- ``exact``: converting a 256-bit integer (< 52!) to exact corresponding 52-card permutation
- ``microsoft``: reverse-engineered seed from Microsoft Solitaire Collection (thanks to ShootMe).

To obtain the Microsoft Solitaire Collection seed, you can access the game's log file at

``%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\logs\solitaire.log``

You'll find them on lines starting with ``SolitaireGameLogic::TryLoadGame`` or ``SolvableDeckAppComponent``

To input your own game, you can use `convert.py` in `script`, to convert the Solvitaire json format into an exact seed, which then you can input into `lonecli`. Currently it only support convert the initial state of the game.

## lonecli commands
### Exact
Turn a seed into the exact permutation number
```sh
lonecli exact [seed_type] [seed]
```

Example run
```
lonecli exact solvitaire 22
```

```

### Random
Do random roll-outs on 10000 different games from seed to seed + 10000 to see how many games it can win

```sh
lonecli random [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

Example run
```
lonecli random default 0 3
```

Example output
```
Total win 1109/10000
```


### Print
```sh
lonecli print [seed_type] [seed]
```
This will print the board in json format (in solvitaire format)

```sh
lonecli print default 0
```

Example output
```json
{"tableau piles": [
["KC"],
["6s","8C"],
["9s","Ah","5S"],
["5d","Js","5h","QD"],
["Ac","7c","Jc","7h","KD"],
["10c","3h","4d","4h","6c","QS"],
["7d","3c","6h","5c","10h","9c","3S"]
],"stock": ["JD","10D","7S","10S","AD","8S","JH","2D","AS","3D","9D","9H","6D","KS","QH","2H","2S","4S","4C","KH","2C","8H","8D","QC"],
"foundation": [[],[],[],[]]}
```
The format:
- Card: <rank><suit>
    - Rank: A, 1..10, J, Q, K
    - Suit: H (heart), D (diamond), C (club), S (spade)
    - Upper case suit => face up card
    - Lower case suit => face down card
- Pile:  An array of cards in order of top-down
- Tableau piles: an array of piles in order of left-right
- Stock: an array of cards in the dealing stock, dealing from the end.
- Foundation: an array of 4 arrays (corresponding to the suits)


### Bench
```sh
lonecli bench [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

Example input
```sh
lonecli bench default 25 3
```

Example output
```
3555 9858569.0515807 op/s
```

The first number is the number of move made. The second one is the rate of move making.

### Solve

```sh
lonecli solve [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

First it will print the game. Then it will solve it.

Example run
```sh
lonecli solve default 41 3
```

Example impossible output
```
Run in 7.0111 ms
Statistic
Total visit: 77625
Transposition hit: 41124 (rate 0.5297777777777778)
Miss state: 36501
Max depth search: 32
Current progress: 1/1 5/5 5/5 6/6 4/4 2/2 3/3 2/2
Impossible
```

It will print the progress every 1 second.

You can early terminate the search by pressing ctrl-C

The progress consists of:
- Total visit: the number of states visited
- Transposition hit: the number of states skipped due to transposition hit and its ratio compare to total visit
- Miss state: the number of states that don't hit transposition table (total visit - transposition hit)
- Max depth search: the maximum number of move made in the search
- Current progress: a list of first 8 current move position/total move in the current search path.

Example run
```sh
lonecli solve default 12 3
```

Example solved output
```
Run in 0.1811 ms
Statistic
Total visit: 119
Transposition hit: 0 (rate 0)
Miss state: 119
Max depth search: 88
Current progress: 0/1 0/5 0/1 0/5 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/3
Solvable in 89 moves

PS A♦, R 5♠, PS A♠, ....

A♣:5▸♣  2♣:5▸♣  8♥:1▸4

JC LK LE IG AH ...
```


There are three type of solution notation:
- The first line is the specialized notation (explained bellow)
- The second line is the standardized notation with the format as `[card]:[source]▸[destination]` or `=` if it's a drawing move .
- The third line is the notation from [Minimal-Klondike](https://github.com/ShootMe/MinimalKlondike) repo.

The source and destination is formatted as:
- D: Deck (the stock)
- 1..7: Pile (the 1-indexed tableaus)
- ♥, ♦, ♣, ♠: Stack (the foundation stack)


### Solve loop
```sh
lonecli rate [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

This will sequentially solve the random game generate from seed, seed+1,...

You can still terminate solving the current game by pressing ctrl-C.

To terminate the whole process, pressing ctrl-C twice in a short amount of time (< 500ms)

Example run
```sh
lonecli rate default 0 3
```

Example output
```

```

### Play

You can play out the game.
Due the optimizations, the available actions are quite unusual, and performing them may result in weird results
- One action can be equivalent to multiple actions combined in standard game
- The result of the action is impossible but it is equivalent to the possible result in the standard game.
- Missing some actions (should be inferior to the available actions)


```sh
lonecli play [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

Example run
```sh
lonecli play default 0 3
```

Example output
```

Hash: 1729382259552616448
Move:
```

You enter the move number to move:

There are currently 5 types of move:
- R ``card``: Revealing the hidden card about the ``card``
- SP ``card``: Moving the ``card`` from the foundation stack into the tableau (the pile in my term)
- DP ``card``: Moving the ``card`` from the stock (the deck in my term) to the tableau
- DS ``card``: Moving the ``card`` from the stock to the foundation stack
- PS ``card``: Moving the ``card`` from the tableau to the stack (potentially also do a reveal)

### HOP solver
In this mode it will try to solve the game with no undo. (actually it is using something more like MCTS not HOP)
```sh
lonecli hop [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

Example run
```sh
lonecli hop default 0 3
```

Example output
```
R Q♠,
R Q♦,
DP 4♣,
...
Solved
```

Example run
```sh
lonecli hop default 6 3
```

Example output
```
DS A♠,
DP J♦,
DS 2♠,
...
Lost
```

### HOP loop
```sh
lonecli hop-loop [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step]
```

- In this mode it will try to solve the game with no undo from the given seed and moving on to the next seed
Example run
```sh
lonecli hop-loop default 0 3
```

Example output
```
1/1 ~ 0.2065 < 1.0000 < 1.0000 in 4.0302814s
2/2 ~ 0.3424 < 1.0000 < 1.0000 in 2.6200513s
2/3 ~ 0.2077 < 0.6667 < 0.9385 in 3.7817279s
3/4 ~ 0.3006 < 0.7500 < 0.9544 in 2.1479847s
...
```


### Graph
Create a game graph of the game from the seed
```sh
lonecli graph [seed_type] [seed] [draw_step] [file.csv]
```

Example run
```sh
lonecli graph klondike-solver 338 3 test.csv
```

Example output

There are 4 columns:
- s: The source id
- t: The destination id
- e: The move type (with more distinction between PileStack PileStackReveal)
- id: The DFS ordering


## Limitations

- Cannot disallow worrying back (but can be supported in the future)
- Not designed to find the shortest solution

## Running results

As far as my knowledge goes, up to May 2024, this solver is the state of the art for checking solvability of a standard 3-card klondike game. I didn't test much on the general case of n-card game, but it is likely to be the best as well.

I cross-checked my package with Solvitaire (published result) using the Klondike-Solver seed from 0 to 50k, and with the 1M games with Solvitaire seed from 1 to 1M. And I also cross-checked between different versions of my own package up to much more games (at least 100k and can be up to 2M games).

However, due to having a lot of game-specific optimizations that haven't been rigorously proven (but I intended to make sure it's always correct, not just a "very good heuristic" but can be wrong in extremely few cases). So any wrong solvability result is a bug.


### Thoughtful Klondike
Run with Solvitaire seed
Run S-1071884 Solved: (878240-0/1071884 ~ 0.8186<=0.8193<=0.8201) 12711939 4517405 93 in 10356.75 ms.

Run with Klondike Solver seed
Run K-5910578 Solved: (4843708-0/5910579 ~ 0.8192<=0.8195<=0.8198) 155 149 102 in 0.60 ms.

So this is the new state of the art result for solvability: 81.95 ± 0.03 (compared to the previous from Solvitaire 81.945 ± 0.084) at 95% confidence

This result is computed on 1 cpu core for a few days. With more resources, it can be easily improved.

One other notable thing is that there's no game that it can't decide in a reasonable amount of time that I'm aware of. The hardest instance I know can be solves in a few minutes

### Random Klondike
So with my hop/MCTS solver, I also achieve the state of the art for random Klondike

7148/15024 ~ 0.4678 < 0.4758 < 0.4838 in 3.171500072s

So the solvability is 47.58 ± 0.80 (compared to the previous 36.97 ± 1.92 from [this paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13363/13211))

The average running time for one game is only a few seconds.

However due to the significant improvement, I think this needs more verification.

## Method

It started from implementing the ideas from the Solvitaire paper in Rust (which is tagged as version 0.1). Then I figure out a suit symmetry in the game state, combining with more dominances (technical term in the Solvitaire paper) and move pruning. This allows me to vastly reduced the states (around an order of magnitude) compared to the original method, combining with highly optimized implementation (around 2 orders of magnitude faster in search rate). In total, it runs around 3 orders of magnitude faster. Also after a lot of move pruning, the game graph is now a DAG (when remove cycles of 2).

I will try to find some time to write a more detailed description of the method.
